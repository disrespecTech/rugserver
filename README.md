# Rugmod

Rugmod is a low-effort carpetmod rip-off for Minecraft 1.8.8. It doesn't do nearly as much, and there's no automatic build scripts for it. It uses MCP to help modify Minecraft, the modifications for which are stored as patch files in this repository.

This was created for the *disrespecTech* server which will eventually play in 1.8 for some time and this mod tries to bring some modern-day tooling/information such as TPS and mobcap logging to old MC.

You are free to build and use this yourself, however no build scripts or help is offered. This mod is for a private server and is only made public for transparency.
